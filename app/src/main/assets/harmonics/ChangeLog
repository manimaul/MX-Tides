2014-12-24

   Imported NOS data from snapshot 2014-12-16.

   Coordinates for reference stations had to be taken from a different page
   this year.  Many stations have moved slightly.

   The erratum for College Pt was removed because the meridian changed back.
   The erratum for Fortescue Creek was removed because the tide table now is
   consistent with the data.

   The harmonics for St. Michael, Norton Sound, Alaska are in disagreement
   with the subordinate station that is presently used for tide tables.
   Higher high tide differs by approximately 1.5 hours.  The correct fix is
   unclear; issue noted but no action.

   The 2013 footnotes table was reused again without further checking.

   Fixed time zone of Port Saint Joe again.

   Fixed spelling of McCready's Creek.

2013-12-28

   Imported NOS data from snapshot 2013-12-10.

   The following reference current stations no longer match NOS predictions
   and have been expired along with all dependent subordinate stations:
     Golden Gate Bridge, California Current (22d)
     San Francisco Bay Entrance (outside), California Current
     Key West, 0.3 mi. W of Ft. Taylor, Florida Current
     Cape Cod Canal (railroad bridge), Massachusetts Current

   Helmick Point added to errata for wrong meridian (thanks AED).

   The 2014 currents web site no longer provides footnotes, but the code
   still references them.  The 2013 footnotes table (from 2012-12 web scrape)
   was reused.  A sampling of stations that referenced footnotes showed no
   disagreement with the 2012 database.

2012-12-24

   Imported NOS data from snapshot 2012-12-22.
   Expired:  Mobile Bay Entrance (off Mobile Point), Alabama Current.
   Renamed several stations.

2012-03-02

   Imported up-to-date NOS harmonic constants for Golden Gate Bridge Current
   contributed by August Hahn, plus the 78 dependent subordinate stations
   from the web snapshot taken 2011-12-11.
